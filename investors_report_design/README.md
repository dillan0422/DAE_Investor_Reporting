# EQUITY INVESTORS REPORT SPREADSHEETS

This directory contains the necessary code to create the summary and pivot spreadsheets for following tabs in the `data pack` spreadsheet report:
- `Overview`
- `Usage`
- `Usage Cohort`
- `DQ`
- `DQ Cohort`
- `Revenues and net margin`
- `Collected Revenue Cohort`

These spreadsheets are used to populate the `Investors Report (Data Pack)`

To create the necessary spreadsheets the bash script `investors_report_sheets.sh` needs to be run.

Once the bash script ran successfully, it is necessary to manually fill each of the tabs of the `Investors Report (Data Pack)`; the report base can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D9g3xih7M0UX9wXlth-5dmXjbnSo0zKikGMAMEPb4oc/edit?usp=sharing)

When it's done, please notify and share it with Wen Bruce to have a final validation of the report.
